# ICA8-Test-1
author - Prem Raj Lokaiahgari

There is an unwritten rule that you must leave at least one urinal open between you and the person using it after you in men's public restrooms with urinals. You would select the urinal on the right instead of the middle, for instance, if there are three urinals and someone is currently urinating in the left one. Therefore, only three individuals at most can urinate at the 5 urinals in public restrooms at the same time when observing this regulation. Only 2 if urinals 2 or 4 are used by the first person.
